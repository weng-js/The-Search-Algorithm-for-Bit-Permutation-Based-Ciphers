# The-Search-Algorithm-for-Bit-Permutation-Based-Ciphers

This repository contains the following:  
1. **Supplementary Information**  
   - Additional data and explanations related to the paper "Improving the Search Algorithm for the Best Differential/Linear Trails of Bit-Permutation-Based Ciphers".  
2. **Experimental Results**  
   - Includes results of the best trail searches and cluster searches.  
3. **Source Codes**  
   - Contains codes for best trail searches and cluster searches.  

### Source Codes Overview  

The repository includes the following:  

1. **Best Differential/Linear Trail Search**  
   - Implements search for RECTANGLE, PRESENT, and LBlock.  
   - Due to structural similarities, these codes can be easily adapted for KNOT (similar to RECTANGLE), GIFT (similar to PRESENT), and TWINE/WARP (similar to LBlock).  

2. **Cluster Search for Differential and Linear Distinguishers**  
   - Provides cluster search codes for KNOT, PRESENT, and WARP.
